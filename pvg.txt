Yes, it's possible to perform the migration without using any additional tools, using just MySQL commands. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Set Up New RDS Instance:**
   - Create a new MySQL RDS instance that will be your destination database.
   - Make sure the instance is properly sized and configured.

2. **Generate MySQL Dumps from Source RDS:**
   - Connect to your source RDS instance using the MySQL client. You can do this from your local machine or from an EC2 instance within the same account.
   - Use the `mysqldump` command to export your databases and tables to SQL dump files. The basic syntax is:
     ```bash
     mysqldump -h <source_rds_endpoint> -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> > dump.sql
     ```
   - Repeat this for all the databases you want to migrate.

3. **Transfer Dump Files:**
   - If you're performing this migration within the same AWS account, you can copy the dump files directly to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to upload the files:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp dump.sql s3://your-bucket-name/
     ```
   
4. **Import Dumps to New RDS:**
   - Connect to your new RDS instance using the MySQL client.
   - Use the MySQL client to import the SQL dump files from the S3 bucket into the new RDS instance. The basic syntax is:
     ```bash
     mysql -h <new_rds_endpoint> -u <username> -p <password> <database_name> < dump.sql
     ```
   - Repeat this for all the dump files.

5. **Update Application Configuration:**
   - Once the data is imported, update your application's configuration to point to the new RDS instance.

6. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Test your application on the new RDS instance to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
   - Verify that all data has been successfully migrated.

7. **Monitoring and Cleanup:**
   - Monitor the new RDS instance's performance and ensure that it's meeting your application's needs.
   - Once you're confident in the new RDS instance's performance and stability, you can consider decommissioning the old RDS instance.

Please note that this process involves manual steps and careful management of credentials, security, and data integrity. Always ensure you have backups of your data and understand the implications of the migration process on your application's availability.
